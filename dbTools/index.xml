      <description>Overview dbView is a query and analysis tool that is intended provide a consistent environment in which to work with different types of databases.
I created and maintain dbView to support my day-to-day work and for this reason dbView is continually evolving and changing as my needs change.
Please see me with any questions and/or for an overview of dbView capabilities.
Thanks, Steve Borcherding
SQLite database library I rely heavily on SQLite (SQLite Home Page) as a versatile database engine for much of the underpinnings of dbView and my related data-related tools.</description>
